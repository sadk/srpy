#summary How to install SRPy

= Introduction =
There are two versions of SRPy available:
  * *srpy-0.1.0.zip*
  * *srpy-bundled-0.1.0.zip*

While *srpy-0.1.0.zip* expects you to have Pyro and Parallel-Python installed, *srpy-bundled-0.1.0.zip* comes already with these packages inside it and is directly ready to run.

*Note:* If you want to use SRPy under Jython we advise you to get the bundled version. Don't forget that SRPy does not support the server running under Jython at this point.

= Installing from source =
SRPy works directly from source, just copy the folder *srpy* to your favorite location and import it.
To start the server do:
`python path/to/srpyapp.py -b`

= Installing through setuptools =
Download your favorite *srpy* version, uncompress it and do `python setup.py install` from inside the uncompressed folder.
